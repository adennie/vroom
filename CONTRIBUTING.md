# How to contribute

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch off the branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* If you haven't already, sign the [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.fizz-buzz.com/cla-individual/).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the project repository.
